        <h1>IGNAZ SEMMELWEIS (1818–1865)</h1>
        <p>
          Known as the “father of infection control”, Dr Ignaz (or Ignac)
          Semmelweis (fig 1) was a Hungarian born physician who received his MD
          degree in Vienna in 1844. In 1847 he was given a 2 year appointment as
          an assistant in obstetrics with responsibility for the First Division
          of the maternity service of the vast Allgemeine Krankenhaus teaching
          hospital in Vienna.4 There he observed that women delivered by
          physicians and medical students had a much higher rate (13–18%) of
          post-delivery mortality (called puerperal fever or childbed fever)
          than women delivered by midwife trainees or midwives (2%).
        </p>
        <p>
          This case-control analysis led Semmelweis to consider several
          hypotheses. He concluded that the higher rates of infections in women
          delivered by physicians and medical students were associated with the
          handling of corpses during autopsies before attending the pregnant
          women. This was not done by the midwives. He associated the exposure
          to cadaveric material with an increased risk of childbed fever,5 and
          conducted a study in which the intervention was hand washing.
        </p>
        <h2>HAND WASHING</h2>
        <p>
          Dr Semmelweis initiated a mandatory hand washing policy for medical
          students and physicians. In a controlled trial using a chloride of
          lime solution,6 the mortality rate fell to about 2%—down to the same
          level as the midwives. Later he started washing the medical
          instruments and the rate decreased to about 1%. His superior,
          Professor Klein, a member of the academic “old guard”, did not accept
          his conclusions. Klein thought the lower mortality was due to the
          hospital’s new ventilation system, an idea that fitted the then
          popular miasmatic theory of disease. Semmelweis convinced a number of
          young faculty members who supported him. They were to become leaders
          of the next academic generation who would make the Allgemeine
          Krankenhaus the world’s greatest teaching hospital for the next half
          century. However, the senior staff won and Semmelweis did not get his
          assistant professorship renewed in 1849. He was offered a clinical
          faculty appointment (privatdozent) without permission to teach from
          cadavers. Feeling betrayed, he fled Vienna, abandoned his supporters,
          and went home to Budapest. In 1851 he was appointed head of obstetrics
          at St Rochus Hospital where he publicly harangued doctors and nurses
          about hand washing and reduced maternal mortality. In 1855 he gave up
          this position to become a professor at Pest University. In 1861 he
          published a book, “The Etiology, Concept, and Prophylaxis of Childbed
          Fever”, but it was badly written and poorly received by the medical
          establishment. About 5 years later he died in a public insane asylum
          at the age of 47.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Dr Semmelweis was the first healthcare professional to
          demonstrate experimentally that hand washing could prevent
          infections,7 it was not until approximately two decades after his
          death that his work was revisited and he was given credit. Only after
          Pasteur, Koch, and Lister had produced more evidence of the germ
          theory and antiseptic techniques was the value of hand washing
          appreciated.
        </p>
        <h2>AN AGENT OF CHANGE</h2>
        <p>
          Semmelweis made salient observations and identified a significant need
          for improvement in the process of patient care. There can be no doubt
          about that. However, he lacked change agent skills. First of all, and
          even though it proved to be one of the great medical publications of
          the 19th century, he did not publish his findings until 14 years after
          his observations.8 Without this evidence, his arrogance and dogmatism
          were not sufficiently convincing to overshadow the other competing
          theories of puerperal fever at that time. The germ theory of disease
          had not yet been developed. A popular theory of the day was that
          miasmas—a bad component in the air—was the cause. Furthermore, the
          calls for proof by his colleagues were interpreted as a personal
          insult. He responded by being rude to them and this made the situation
          worse. He wrote to one obstetrician in Vienna: “You, Herr Professor,
          have been a partner in this massacre.” To another he wrote: “Should
          you, Herr Hofrath, without having disproved my doctrine, continue to
          train your pupils [against it], I declare before God and the world
          that you are a murderer and the ‘History of Childbed Fever’ would not
          be unjust to you if it memorialized you as a medical Nero.” Some
          colleagues evaded or even sabotaged his hand washing regimen.9 He was
          not able to persuade others to see his vision for improvement. His
          frustration, rage, and ego all became obstacles for him to implement
          his changes for healthcare improvement. Physicians resisted these
          changes for several reasons. Washing of hands before treating each
          patient would be too much work. In the long run, solving this problem
          would require rebuilding hospitals so that sinks and running water
          were within reach. The profession of being a physician was divinely
          blessed, so it would be unreasonable to think they could cause
          disease. Semmelweis was saying that doctors were the cause of death.
          Egos were often inversely proportional to the evidence, and the
          scientific evidence was very scant at this time.
        </p>
        <h2>HERO OR MARTYR?</h2>
        <p>
          A hero of quality and safety has to be able both to discover
          opportunities for improvement and to implement the system changes
          necessary for the improvement. Semmelweis succeeded in the first and
          failed in the second. He was a martyr in his life time and later a
          hero—the “savior of mothers”. On the 100th anniversary of his death
          Austria issued a postage stamp in his honor (fig 1) and the Budapest
          medical school at which he taught is now the Semmelweis University of
          Medicine.
        </p>
        <h2>BUT AS A CHANGE AGENT?</h2>
        <p>
          Insult your enemies, accuse your superiors of causing the deaths of
          mothers, actively join academic political factions, abandon your
          friends, refuse to publish, but when you do so write incomprehensibly,
          use public humiliation and haranguing to change behaviour, and be
          arrogant and angry yourself. This will not work every time.
